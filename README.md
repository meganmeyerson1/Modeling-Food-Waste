# Modeling-Food-Waste
The first section of the code replicates the graphs of Mengling Tian and Yangyang Zheng’s paper “How to Reduce Food Waste Caused by Normative Illusion? A Study Based on Evolutionary Game Model Analysis” that model the dynamical system. 
The second section introduces experiments with additive and multiplicative noise (the system breaks down very quickly under the addition of noise).
The final section graphs the conserved quantity of the system (credit to Chris Wiggins of Columbia University for discovering the quantity).
If you have any suggestions please let us know! We hope this is helpful for anyone studying policy-based strategies to reduce food waste.
